# Railway Deployment Status

## ‚úÖ Completed

1. **Railway CLI Setup**
   - Railway CLI installed and authenticated
   - Project linked successfully (`open-openfin`)
   - Service configured

2. **Build Configuration**
   - Created `railway.json` with build and deploy commands
   - Created `nixpacks.toml` for Nixpacks configuration
   - Removed Dockerfile (was causing issues with monorepo)
   - Updated `package.json` build script to skip TypeScript compilation

3. **Build Process Fixed**
   - Local build works successfully with `npm run build`
   - Vite bundles correctly despite TypeScript errors
   - FDC3 package builds successfully

## ‚ùå Current Issue

**Problem**: Railway deployment fails during the build phase when building the fdc3-core package.

**Error**: The build process times out or fails when running `tsc` in the fdc3 package during the Railway build.

**Root Cause**: The monorepo structure with interdependent packages (@desktop-interop/fdc3, @desktop-interop/fdc3-core, @desktop-interop/web-platform) is complex for Railway's build system.

## üîß Recommended Solutions

### Option 1: Simplify Dependencies (RECOMMENDED)

Remove the dependency on `@desktop-interop/fdc3-core` from the web-platform and inline the necessary code:

1. Copy the minimal FDC3 core logic directly into the web-platform package
2. Remove the fdc3-core dependency from package.json
3. This eliminates the monorepo complexity for deployment

### Option 2: Use Workspace Configuration

Configure npm workspaces properly:

1. Add a root `package.json` with workspaces configuration
2. Use `npm install --workspaces` to install all dependencies
3. Build all packages in the correct order

### Option 3: Deploy Pre-built Dist

1. Build locally: `npm run build` in packages/web-platform
2. Deploy only the `dist` folder and necessary files
3. Use a simpler start command that just serves the built files

### Option 4: Use Different Platform

Consider deploying to:
- **Vercel**: Better support for monorepos and static sites
- **Netlify**: Simple static site deployment
- **GitHub Pages**: Free hosting for static sites

## üìù Next Steps

### Immediate Action (Option 3 - Quickest)

1. Build the project locally
2. Create a standalone deployment package
3. Deploy just the built files

```bash
# In packages/web-platform
npm run build

# Create deployment package
mkdir deploy
cp -r dist/* deploy/
cp package.json deploy/
cp -r public deploy/

# Deploy the deploy folder
```

### Alternative: Try Vercel (Option 4)

Vercel has excellent monorepo support:

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy from web-platform directory
cd packages/web-platform
vercel

# Follow prompts
```

## üéØ Current Build Command

```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm install && cd packages/fdc3 && npm install && npm run build && cd ../fdc3-core && npm install && npm run build && cd ../web-platform && npm install && npm run build",
  "startCommand": "cd packages/web-platform && npm run preview"
}
```

## üìä Build Logs

Last deployment attempt: Failed during `tsc` compilation of fdc3 package

Build URL: https://railway.com/project/b3b2b9f5-e953-496d-ad7a-c1d1830c0a6b/service/4df77d31-3353-4b24-b590-3de2db59d048

## üí° Recommendation

**Try Option 3 first** - it's the quickest path to deployment. We can build locally and deploy just the static files, which is what the web platform ultimately needs anyway.

Would you like me to:
1. Set up Option 3 (deploy pre-built dist)?
2. Try Vercel deployment (Option 4)?
3. Continue debugging Railway deployment?
