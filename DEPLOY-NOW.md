# 🚀 Deploy Open OpenFin Web Platform to Railway - FINAL STEPS

## Current Status

✅ Railway project linked
✅ Build works locally  
✅ Configuration files created
❌ Deployment failing due to monorepo complexity

## 🎯 Solution: Deploy from Root with Proper Build

The issue is that we're trying to deploy from `packages/web-platform` but it needs the parent packages built first.

### Deploy from Root Directory

Run these commands from the **root** of the repository:

```bash
# Make sure you're in the root directory
cd /d/repos-personal/repos/open-openfin

# Deploy from root
railway up
```

The root `railway.json` and `nixpacks.toml` are already configured to:
1. Install all dependencies
2. Build fdc3 package
3. Build fdc3-core package  
4. Build web-platform package
5. Start the preview server

## 📋 What Will Happen

Railway will:
1. ✅ Install Node.js 18
2. ✅ Run `npm install` in root
3. ✅ Build packages/fdc3
4. ✅ Build packages/fdc3-core
5. ✅ Build packages/web-platform
6. ✅ Start preview server on assigned PORT
7. ✅ Give you a live URL!

## 🔍 If It Still Fails

### Check the Build Logs

The build logs URL will be shown in the terminal. Look for:
- TypeScript compilation errors
- Missing dependencies
- Build timeouts

### Alternative: Manual Build + Deploy

If the automated build continues to fail, we can:

1. **Build locally**:
```bash
cd packages/fdc3
npm install && npm run build

cd ../fdc3-core  
npm install && npm run build

cd ../web-platform
npm install && npm run build
```

2. **Commit the dist folder** (temporarily):
```bash
git add packages/web-platform/dist -f
git commit -m "Add built files for deployment"
```

3. **Deploy**:
```bash
railway up
```

4. **Update nixpacks.toml** to skip build:
```toml
[phases.setup]
nixPkgs = ["nodejs-18_x"]

[phases.install]
cmds = ["npm install -g serve"]

[start]
cmd = "cd packages/web-platform && serve dist -l $PORT"
```

## 🎉 Success Indicators

When deployment succeeds, you'll see:
- ✅ "Build successful"
- ✅ "Deployment live"
- ✅ A URL like: `https://open-openfin-production.up.railway.app`

## 🧪 Test Your Deployment

Once live, test:
1. Open the URL
2. Click "Launch App" for Ticker List
3. Click on a stock symbol
4. Verify Ticker Details opens
5. Check FDC3 Monitor shows messages
6. Try adding an external app
