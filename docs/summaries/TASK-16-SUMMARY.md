- Metadata with tags and author info

**Layout Configuration:**
- Sample App 1: 700x500 at (100, 100) - Left side
- Sample App 2: 700x500 at (850, 100) - Right side
- Both windows in normal state
- Positioned for simultaneous visibility

**Documentation:**
- Comprehensive README with usage instructions
- Workspace configuration schema
- Testing workflows for FDC3 features
- Custom workspace creation guide
- Workspace management API examples
- Best practices

## Testing Workflows

### 1. Context Broadcasting Test
1. Launch workspace
2. Both apps join the same channel (e.g., red)
3. App 1 broadcasts instrument context
4. App 2 receives and displays the context
5. Verify context appears in App 2's received contexts list

### 2. Intent Resolution Test
1. Launch workspace
2. App 1 broadcasts context to App 2
3. App 2 receives context
4. App 2 raises ViewChart or ViewNews intent
5. Platform resolves intent to App 1
6. App 1 receives and handles the intent
7. Verify App 1 UI updates with intent data

### 3. Channel Switching Test
1. Launch workspace
2. App 1 joins red channel
3. App 2 joins blue channel
4. App 1 broadcasts context
5. Verify App 2 does NOT receive context (different channels)
6. App 2 switches to red channel
7. App 1 broadcasts again
8. Verify App 2 receives context (same channel)

### 4. Multi-Channel Test
1. Launch workspace
2. Test all channel combinations (red, blue, green)
3. Verify context isolation between channels
4. Test leave channel functionality
5. Verify no context received after leaving channel

## Requirements Satisfied

### Requirement 4.2: Context Broadcasting ✅
- App 1 broadcasts instrument context
- App 2 listens for instrument context
- Context delivered to subscribed applications

### Requirement 4.3: Intent Resolution ✅
- App 2 raises ViewChart and ViewNews intents
- App 1 handles ViewChart and ViewNews intents
- Intent resolution working between applications

### Requirement 4.6: User Channels ✅
- Both apps support joining user channels
- Channel switching UI implemented
- Context isolation per channel
- Leave channel functionality

### Requirement 9.4: Workspace Management ✅
- Workspace configuration defined
- Multiple applications in workspace
- Window layout specified
- Auto-launch configuration

## Integration Points

### With FDC3 Service
- Uses `window.fdc3.broadcast()`
- Uses `window.fdc3.raiseIntent()`
- Uses `window.fdc3.addContextListener()`
- Uses `window.fdc3.addIntentListener()`
- Uses `window.fdc3.joinUserChannel()`
- Uses `window.fdc3.leaveCurrentChannel()`

### With Platform Provider
- Workspace can be loaded via WorkspaceManager
- Layout can be applied via LayoutManager
- Applications launched via ApplicationLifecycleManager

### With Application Directory
- Applications registered with intents
- Intent handlers discoverable
- Manifest-based configuration

## Next Steps

To use these sample applications:

1. **Launch Individual Apps:**
   ```javascript
   await fin.Application.create({
     manifestUrl: 'file:///apps/sample-app-1/manifest.json'
   }).run();
   ```

2. **Launch Workspace:**
   ```javascript
   const workspace = await fin.Platform.getCurrentSync()
     .getWorkspaceManager()
     .getWorkspace('sample-workspace-1');
   await workspace.launch();
   ```

3. **Test FDC3 Features:**
   - Follow testing workflows in workspace README
   - Verify context broadcasting
   - Verify intent resolution
   - Verify channel isolation

## Status
✅ Task 16 Complete - All sample applications and workspace configuration created and documented.

## Visual Design

### Sample App 1 (Broadcaster)
- Purple gradient background (#667eea to #764ba2)
- Clean, modern UI with glassmorphism effect
- Input fields for ticker and company name
- Prominent broadcast button
- Channel join buttons
- Status display area

### Sample App 2 (Listener)
- Pink/red gradient background (#f093fb to #f5576c)
- Matching glassmorphism design
- Channel switching buttons
- Intent raising buttons
- Received contexts list with timestamps
- Visual indicators for context items

Both apps use consistent styling with:
- Rounded corners
- Backdrop blur effects
- Hover states on buttons
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Responsive layouts
