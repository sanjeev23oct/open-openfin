# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a desktop interoperability platform that enables seamless communication and workflow orchestration between multiple applications running on the desktop. The platform will provide a runtime environment, inter-application messaging (FDC3 standard), window management, and application lifecycle management capabilities similar to OpenFin.

The goal is to create a secure, performant desktop container that allows web-based and native applications to interoperate, share context, and provide a unified user experience across disparate applications in enterprise environments.

1. WHEN an application manifest is provided THEN the system SHALL validate and parse the manifest configuration
2. WHEN an application is launched THEN the system SHALL create an application instance with specified configuration
3. WHEN an application needs to be closed THEN the system SHALL provide graceful shutdown with cleanup of resources
4. IF an application crashes THEN the system SHALL detect the crash and optionally restart the application
5. WHEN multiple versions of an application exist THEN the system SHALL support version management and rollback capabilities
6. WHEN an application is launched THEN the system SHALL enforce security policies defined in the manifest

### Requirement 3: Window Management

**User Story:** As an end user, I want sophisticated window management capabilities, so that I can organize multiple applications efficiently on my desktop.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a window is created THEN the system SHALL support customizable window chrome, borders, and styling
2. WHEN windows need to be arranged THEN the system SHALL provide APIs for programmatic window positioning and sizing
3. WHEN windows are grouped THEN the system SHALL support window grouping and tabbing functionality
4. WHEN a window is docked THEN the system SHALL provide snap-to-edge and docking capabilities
5. WHEN windows are minimized or maximized THEN the system SHALL maintain window state across sessions
6. WHEN multiple monitors are present THEN the system SHALL support multi-monitor window management
7. WHEN a window is moved THEN the system SHALL emit events for window state changes

### Requirement 4: FDC3 Inter-Application Messaging

**User Story:** As a developer, I want standards-based inter-application communication, so that applications can share context and coordinate workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the platform initializes THEN the system SHALL provide an FDC3-compliant messaging bus
2. WHEN an application broadcasts context THEN the system SHALL deliver the context to all subscribed applications
3. WHEN an application raises an intent THEN the system SHALL resolve the intent to appropriate handler applications
4. IF multiple applications can handle an intent THEN the system SHALL present a resolver UI for user selection
5. WHEN context is shared THEN the system SHALL support standard FDC3 context types (instrument, contact, organization, etc.)
6. WHEN applications join a channel THEN the system SHALL support user channels and app channels for context isolation
7. WHEN private communication is needed THEN the system SHALL support private channels between specific applications

### Requirement 5: Application Discovery and Directory

**User Story:** As an end user, I want to discover and launch available applications, so that I can access the tools I need for my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the platform starts THEN the system SHALL provide an application directory service
2. WHEN a user searches for applications THEN the system SHALL return matching applications based on name, description, or tags
3. WHEN an application is launched from the directory THEN the system SHALL instantiate the application with proper configuration
4. WHEN applications are registered THEN the system SHALL validate application manifests and metadata
5. IF an application is unavailable THEN the system SHALL indicate the status to the user
6. WHEN intent resolution occurs THEN the system SHALL query the directory for applications supporting the intent

### Requirement 6: Security and Permissions

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want granular security controls, so that I can enforce enterprise security policies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an application requests permissions THEN the system SHALL enforce a permission model for sensitive operations
2. WHEN applications communicate THEN the system SHALL validate that applications have permission to exchange data
3. WHEN external URLs are accessed THEN the system SHALL enforce content security policies and URL whitelisting
4. WHEN data is stored THEN the system SHALL provide encrypted storage for sensitive application data
5. IF an application attempts unauthorized operations THEN the system SHALL block the operation and log the attempt
6. WHEN applications are sandboxed THEN the system SHALL isolate application contexts to prevent unauthorized access

### Requirement 7: Notifications and System Integration

**User Story:** As an end user, I want native desktop notifications and system integration, so that applications feel like native desktop applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an application sends a notification THEN the system SHALL display native OS notifications
2. WHEN a notification is clicked THEN the system SHALL route the action to the originating application
3. WHEN system tray integration is needed THEN the system SHALL support system tray icons and menus
4. WHEN keyboard shortcuts are defined THEN the system SHALL register and handle global keyboard shortcuts
5. WHEN clipboard operations occur THEN the system SHALL provide secure clipboard access with permission controls

### Requirement 8: Platform APIs and SDK

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive APIs and SDKs, so that I can build rich interoperable applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria
