# Requirements Document - Web-Based Interop Platform

## Introduction

This feature enables the Desktop Interop Platform to run entirely in a web browser, similar to interop.io's Glue42 Core (browser-based solution). Users can access the platform without installing any desktop application.

**Architecture Approach (Similar to interop.io):**
- **Single Browser Tab Container**: The platform runs in ONE main browser tab/window
- **Applications in iframes**: Each application runs in an iframe within the container
- **Window Management**: Visual window management within the single tab (like a desktop within the browser)
- **Shared Context**: All applications share context within the same tab via JavaScript (not across browser tabs)
- **Optional Multi-Tab**: Advanced mode where applications can open in separate browser tabs but still communicate

This is different from "cross-browser-tab" communication. Instead, it's a **contained workspace** in a single browser tab, where multiple application iframes communicate via FDC3.

The web-based platform will maintain feature parity with the desktop version where possible, while gracefully degrading features that require native OS integration. This enables:
- Zero-installation deployment
- Cross-platform compatibility (any modern browser)
- Easy sharing via URL
- Cloud-hosted applications
- Mobile browser support (limited features)

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Browser-Based Runtime Environment

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access the interop platform directly in my browser without installing any desktop application, so that I can quickly start using FDC3-enabled applications from any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the platform URL THEN the platform SHALL load and initialize entirely in the browser
2. WHEN the platform initializes THEN it SHALL detect browser capabilities AND display compatibility warnings for unsupported features
3. WHEN the platform loads THEN it SHALL use Service Workers for background processing AND SharedWorkers for cross-tab communication
4. IF the browser does not support required APIs THEN the platform SHALL display a clear error message WITH links to supported browsers
5. WHEN multiple tabs are open THEN they SHALL share a single platform instance via SharedWorker
6. WHEN the platform is accessed on mobile THEN it SHALL provide a responsive mobile-optimized interface

### Requirement 2: In-Browser Window Management (Single Tab Container)

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage multiple application windows within a single browser tab, so that I can organize my workspace like a desktop environment without opening multiple browser tabs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user launches an application THEN it SHALL open in an iframe-based window within the main container tab
2. WHEN a user drags a window THEN it SHALL move within the browser tab viewport using absolute positioning
3. WHEN a user resizes a window THEN it SHALL maintain aspect ratio constraints defined in the manifest

5. WHEN a user docks a window THEN it SHALL snap to predefined zones within the browser tab viewport
6. WHEN the browser window resizes THEN application windows SHALL reposition proportionally within the tab
7. WHEN a window is maximized THEN it SHALL fill the browser tab viewport (not the OS screen)
8. WHEN the user wants multi-tab mode THEN applications CAN optionally open in separate browser tabs with maintained FDC3 communication

### Requirement 3: In-Container FDC3 Messaging (Primary Mode)

**User Story:** As a developer, I want FDC3 messaging to work between all applications in the browser container, so that applications can communicate seamlessly within the same tab.

2. WHEN an intent is raised THEN the platform SHALL resolve it among applications in the container
3. WHEN a channel is joined THEN the application SHALL receive contexts from that channel within the container
4. WHEN applications are in iframes THEN they SHALL communicate via postMessage with the platform
5. WHEN the platform receives a message THEN it SHALL validate the source AND route to appropriate applications
6. WHEN an application crashes THEN other applications SHALL continue to function
7. WHEN in multi-tab mode (optional) THEN SharedWorker OR BroadcastChannel SHALL enable cross-tab communication

### Requirement 4: Browser-Based Workspace Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to save and restore my workspace configuration in the browser, so that I can quickly resume my work across sessions.

2. WHEN a user loads a workspace THEN all applications SHALL open in their saved positions
3. WHEN a workspace is shared THEN it SHALL generate a shareable URL with workspace configuration
4. WHEN a user opens a shared workspace URL THEN it SHALL restore the exact configuration
5. WHEN storage quota is exceeded THEN the platform SHALL prompt to delete old workspaces
6. WHEN a workspace includes external URLs THEN it SHALL respect CORS policies
7. WHEN offline THEN the platform SHALL load cached workspace configurations

### Requirement 5: Application Hosting and Sandboxing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to host applications securely in the browser platform, so that they're isolated from each other and the platform.

2. WHEN an application requests permissions THEN the platform SHALL prompt the user for approval
3. WHEN an application violates CSP THEN it SHALL be blocked AND the user SHALL be notified
4. WHEN applications communicate THEN they SHALL only use the FDC3 API (no direct DOM access)
5. IF an application crashes THEN it SHALL not affect other applications OR the platform
6. WHEN an application is untrusted THEN it SHALL have additional restrictions (no popups, no storage access)
7. WHEN an application requests camera/microphone THEN the browser's native permission dialog SHALL be used

### Requirement 6: Progressive Web App (PWA) Support

**User Story:** As a user, I want to install the platform as a PWA, so that it feels like a native application with offline support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the platform THEN the browser SHALL offer to install it as a PWA
2. WHEN installed as PWA THEN it SHALL have an app icon AND launch in standalone mode
3. WHEN offline THEN the platform SHALL load from cache AND display offline-capable applications
4. WHEN the platform updates THEN it SHALL prompt the user to reload for the new version
5. WHEN installed THEN it SHALL support push notifications for FDC3 events
6. WHEN launched as PWA THEN it SHALL restore the last workspace automatically
7. WHEN storage is cleared THEN the platform SHALL handle gracefully without crashing

### Requirement 7: URL-Based Application Launching

**User Story:** As a user, I want to launch applications via URL parameters, so that I can share deep links to specific application states.

#### Acceptance Criteria
