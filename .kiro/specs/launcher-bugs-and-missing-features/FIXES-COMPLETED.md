# Launcher Bugs - Fixes Completed

## ‚úÖ Fixed Issues

### 1. FDC3 Channel Join Failure
**Problem:** Apps were showing "Failed to join channel" error when clicking the "Join Channel" button.

**Root Cause:** The `test-preload.js` file path was incorrect in `platform-launcher.js`. It was looking for the file in the root directory instead of the `tests/` folder.

**Solution:** Updated both `launchApplication` and `launchApplicationWithManifest` functions to use the correct path:
```javascript
preload: path.join(__dirname, 'tests', 'test-preload.js')
```

**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED - Apps can now successfully join FDC3 channels and communicate

### 2. Window Auto-Arrangement
**Problem:** All windows were opening on top of each other, making it difficult to see and manage multiple applications.

**Root Cause:** No auto-positioning logic existed. Windows used default or manifest-specified positions without checking for overlaps.

**Solution:** Implemented smart `calculateWindowPosition()` function with:
- **First window:** Centers on screen
- **Subsequent windows:** Cascade pattern with 30px offset
- **Fallback:** Tiling algorithm if cascade space exhausted
- **Respects:** Manual positioning from manifest files

**Algorithm Details:**
1. If no windows open ‚Üí center the window
2. Try cascade pattern (up to 10 positions)
3. Check for overlaps with existing windows
4. If cascade fails ‚Üí try tiling grid
5. Final fallback ‚Üí slight offset from center

**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED - Windows now intelligently arrange themselves

### 3. App Styling and Visual Design
**Problem:** Apps had inconsistent styling and poor visual design.

**Solution:** 
- Updated to clean, professional light theme
- Improved typography and spacing
- Better color scheme with proper contrast
- Professional button styling with hover effects
- Consistent design across ticker apps

**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED - Apps now have enterprise-grade appearance

## üß™ Testing Instructions

### Test FDC3 Fix:
1. Run `npm start`
2. Launch "Market Watch" app
3. Click "Join Channel" button
4. Should see "Connected to Red Channel" (no error)
5. Launch "Ticker Details" app
6. Click any ticker in Market Watch
7. Details should appear in Ticker Details app

### Test Auto-Arrangement:
1. Run `npm start`
2. Launch first app ‚Üí should center on screen
3. Launch second app ‚Üí should cascade (offset by 30px)
4. Launch third app ‚Üí should cascade further
5. Continue launching ‚Üí should tile if cascade exhausted
6. No windows should completely overlap

## üìù Notes

- Modern launcher is working correctly
- FDC3 communication is functional
- Basic window management exists but needs enhancement
- Tab-based grouping works but needs synchronized movement
- Context menu exists but needs more options
