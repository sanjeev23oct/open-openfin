# Honest Assessment - What's Actually Wrong

## The Truth

I implemented complex features without testing them. The code I wrote is too complicated and doesn't work in practice. I need to start over with a simpler, working approach.

## What You Actually Need (Simple Version)

### 1. Auto-Arrangement
**What you want:** Windows don't overlap when launched
**What I did:** Wrote complex cascade logic
**Problem:** Manifests override it, and even after fixing manifests, it might not work
**Simple fix needed:** Just offset each window by 50px from previous

### 2. Side-by-Side Windows
**What you want:** Put 2 windows side by side easily
**What I did:** Complex snapping with overlays
**Problem:** Overlay might not show, snapping might not work
**Simple fix needed:** Just a button "Snap Left" and "Snap Right" that works

### 3. Move Together
**What you want:** When grouped, windows move together while staying side by side
**What I did:** Tab-based grouping (hides one window) + complex movement listeners
**Problem:** This is WRONG - you want them VISIBLE side by side, not tabbed!
**Simple fix needed:** Keep both visible, track movement, move the other one

### 4. Workspaces
**What you want:** Save and restore window positions
**What I did:** Complex save/load with validation
**Problem:** Might have bugs in save/load logic
**Simple fix needed:** Just JSON.stringify the positions, JSON.parse to restore

## What I Should Do Now

### Option 1: Start Fresh (Recommended)
- Delete all my complex code
- Write SIMPLE versions that actually work
- Test each feature before moving to next
- No fancy overlays, no complex listeners, just basic functionality

### Option 2: Debug Current Code
- Add console.log everywhere
- Test each function individually
- Fix bugs one by one
- This will take longer and might still not work

## My Recommendation

Let me start over with a MINIMAL implementation:

1. **Auto-arrangement:** Simple 50px offset, no cascade logic
2. **Snap buttons:** Add "Snap Left" / "Snap Right" buttons to launcher
3. **Side-by-side grouping:** Keep both windows visible, simple movement tracking
4. **Workspaces:** Basic JSON save/load, no validation

This will take 30 minutes and will ACTUALLY WORK.

## Your Decision

Do you want me to:
A) Start fresh with simple, working code?
B) Try to debug the current complex code?
C) Something else?

I apologize for wasting your time with code that doesn't work. I should have tested as I went.
