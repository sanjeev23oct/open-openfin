## üêõ Common Issues and Fixes

### Issue: Windows still overlap
**Fix:** Manifests had hardcoded positions - I removed them. Restart platform.

### Issue: No blue snap overlay
**Fix:** Check console for errors. Overlay window might fail to create.

### Issue: Windows don't move together when grouped
**Fix:** Check console for "enableGroupMovement" errors. Event listeners might not attach.

### Issue: Workspace doesn't save
**Fix:** Check permissions on `~/.desktop-interop-platform/` folder.

### Issue: Right-click menu doesn't appear
**Fix:** Context menu listener might not be attached. Check console.

## üí° Tips

- **To get 2 windows side by side:**
  1. Launch 2 apps
  2. Drag first to left edge (see blue overlay, release to snap)
  3. Drag second to right edge (see blue overlay, release to snap)
  4. Right-click one ‚Üí Group with ‚Üí select other
  5. Now drag either one ‚Üí both move together!

- **Snap threshold:** 20 pixels from edge triggers snap
