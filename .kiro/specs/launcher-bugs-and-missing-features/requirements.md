# Requirements Document - Launcher Bugs and Missing Features

## Introduction

The modern launcher has a beautiful look and feel but is missing critical features that were present in the old launcher. Additionally, window management features are not working as expected, making the platform less user-friendly. This spec addresses bugs and missing functionality to restore full feature parity while maintaining the improved visual design.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Workspace Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create, save, and load workspaces so that I can organize my applications into different layouts and quickly switch between them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the launcher THEN they SHALL see a "Workspaces" tab or section
2. WHEN the user clicks "Create Workspace" THEN the system SHALL allow them to name and save the current application layout
3. WHEN the user has saved workspaces THEN they SHALL be able to see a list of all saved workspaces
4. WHEN the user clicks on a saved workspace THEN the system SHALL load all applications in their saved positions and sizes
5. WHEN the user modifies a workspace THEN they SHALL be able to save changes or save as a new workspace
6. WHEN the user wants to delete a workspace THEN they SHALL have an option to remove it from the list

### Requirement 2: Auto-Arrangement of Windows

**User Story:** As a user, I want newly launched applications to be automatically arranged on screen so that they don't all open on top of each other.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user launches the first application THEN it SHALL open in a default position (e.g., center or top-left)
2. WHEN the user launches additional applications THEN they SHALL be automatically positioned to avoid overlapping existing windows
3. WHEN multiple applications are open THEN the system SHALL use an intelligent tiling or cascading algorithm
4. WHEN the screen space is limited THEN the system SHALL still arrange windows in a usable manner
5. IF the user manually moves a window THEN subsequent auto-arrangement SHALL respect the user's manual positioning

### Requirement 3: Window Grouping with Synchronized Movement

**User Story:** As a user, I want to group windows together so that when I move one window, all grouped windows move together maintaining their relative positions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user groups two or more windows THEN they SHALL move together as a single unit
2. WHEN the user drags a grouped window THEN all windows in the group SHALL move maintaining their relative positions
3. WHEN the user resizes a grouped window THEN the system SHALL handle the resize appropriately for the group
4. WHEN the user wants to ungroup windows THEN they SHALL be able to remove individual windows from the group
5. WHEN windows are grouped THEN there SHALL be a visual indicator showing which windows belong to the same group

### Requirement 4: Window Snapping

**User Story:** As a user, I want windows to snap to screen edges and other windows so that I can quickly arrange my workspace in an organized manner.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user drags a window near a screen edge THEN it SHALL snap to that edge with visual feedback
2. WHEN the user drags a window near another window THEN it SHALL snap to align with the other window's edges
3. WHEN snapping occurs THEN the system SHALL show a visual preview of where the window will snap
4. WHEN the user releases the window while snapping THEN it SHALL be positioned at the snap location
5. WHEN the user holds a modifier key (e.g., Shift) THEN snapping SHALL be temporarily disabled
6. WHEN windows snap to screen edges THEN they SHALL support common layouts (left half, right half, quarters, etc.)

### Requirement 5: Improved Window Management Context Menu

**User Story:** As a user, I want an easy-to-access context menu for window management so that I can quickly perform common window operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user right-clicks on a window title bar or app in launcher THEN they SHALL see a context menu with window management options
2. WHEN the context menu is displayed THEN it SHALL include options for: snap to positions, group with other windows, minimize, maximize, close
3. WHEN the user selects a snap position THEN the window SHALL immediately move to that position
4. WHEN the user selects "Group with..." THEN they SHALL see a list of other open windows to group with
5. WHEN the user performs an action from the context menu THEN the menu SHALL close and the action SHALL execute immediately

### Requirement 6: Visual Feedback for Window Operations

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear visual feedback during window operations so that I understand what will happen before I complete the action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user drags a window THEN there SHALL be a semi-transparent preview showing the window's position
2. WHEN snapping is about to occur THEN there SHALL be a highlighted zone showing where the window will snap
3. WHEN windows are grouped THEN there SHALL be a visual indicator (e.g., colored border or badge) on all grouped windows
4. WHEN the user hovers over a snap zone THEN it SHALL highlight to indicate it's a valid drop target
5. WHEN an operation is in progress THEN the cursor SHALL change to indicate the current operation

### Requirement 7: Persistent Window State

**User Story:** As a user, I want my window positions and groups to be remembered so that when I restart the platform, my workspace is restored.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user closes the platform THEN the system SHALL save all window positions, sizes, and groups
2. WHEN the user reopens the platform THEN the system SHALL restore the previous window layout
3. WHEN applications are part of a workspace THEN their state SHALL be saved with the workspace
4. WHEN the user has multiple monitors THEN window positions SHALL be saved relative to the correct monitor
5. IF a saved window position is no longer valid (e.g., monitor disconnected) THEN the system SHALL place the window in a default position

### Requirement 8: Keyboard Shortcuts for Window Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want keyboard shortcuts for common window management tasks so that I can work more efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user presses Win+Left Arrow THEN the active window SHALL snap to the left half of the screen
2. WHEN the user presses Win+Right Arrow THEN the active window SHALL snap to the right half of the screen
3. WHEN the user presses Win+Up Arrow THEN the active window SHALL maximize
4. WHEN the user presses Win+Down Arrow THEN the active window SHALL restore or minimize
5. WHEN the user presses a custom shortcut THEN they SHALL be able to trigger workspace switching or other platform features
6. WHEN keyboard shortcuts conflict with system shortcuts THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully

### Requirement 9: Drag and Drop Window Grouping

**User Story:** As a user, I want to group windows by dragging one window onto another so that grouping is intuitive and quick.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user drags a window over another window THEN a visual indicator SHALL show that grouping is possible
2. WHEN the user drops a window onto another window THEN they SHALL be grouped together
3. WHEN windows are grouped via drag and drop THEN a tab bar SHALL appear showing all grouped windows
4. WHEN the user drags a tab out of a group THEN it SHALL become an independent window again
5. WHEN the user drags a window to a specific edge of another window THEN it SHALL dock to that side (optional advanced feature)

### Requirement 10: Enhanced Launcher Features

**User Story:** As a user, I want the launcher to show me useful information about running apps and provide quick actions so that I can manage my workspace efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the launcher displays running apps THEN it SHALL show their current state (minimized, maximized, grouped)
2. WHEN the user right-clicks an app in the launcher THEN they SHALL see quick actions (close, minimize, snap to position)
3. WHEN apps are grouped THEN the launcher SHALL indicate which apps are in the same group
4. WHEN the user searches for an app THEN the search SHALL include both installed and running apps
5. WHEN the user has favorite apps THEN they SHALL appear in a prominent section for quick access
