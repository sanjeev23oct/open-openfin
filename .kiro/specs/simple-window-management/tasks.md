## Implementation Order

Tasks will be implemented in order 1-6. Each task will be:
1. Implemented
2. Tested immediately
3. Marked complete only if working
4. Debugged if not working before moving to next task

## Testing After Each Task

### Task 1 Test:
```
1. npm start
2. Launch Market Watch
3. Launch Ticker Details  
4. Launch Sample App 1
5. Verify: No windows overlap, each offset by ~50px
```

### Task 2 Test:
```
1. Launch any app
2. Right-click window
3. Click "Snap Left"
4. Verify: Window fills left half
5. Right-click again
6. Click "Snap Right"
7. Verify: Window fills right half
```

### Task 3 Test:
```
1. Launch 2 apps
2. Snap one left, one right
3. Right-click left window
4. Click "Link with..." â†’ select right window
5. Drag left window
6. Verify: Right window moves same amount
7. Right-click, click "Unlink"
8. Drag left window
9. Verify: Right window stays still
```

### Task 4 Test:
```
1. Launch 2-3 apps, position them
2. Go to Workspaces tab
3. Click "Save Workspace", name it "Test"
4. Close all apps
5. Click "Load Workspace" on "Test"
6. Verify: Apps launch in saved positions
```

### Task 5 Test:
```
1. In launcher, verify all apps show "Launch"
2. Launch Market Watch
3. Verify: Shows "Focus" with green dot
4. Click "Focus"
5. Verify: Window comes to front
6. Close Market Watch
7. Verify: Shows "Launch" again
```

### Task 6 Test:
```
1. Launch 3 apps (auto-positioned)
2. Snap 2 of them side-by-side
3. Link those 2
4. Drag them around (should move together)
5. Save as workspace
6. Close all
7. Load workspace
8. Verify: Apps in correct positions
9. Verify: Link still works
```

## Success Criteria

- All 6 tasks complete and tested
- All tests pass
- No console errors
- User can perform all workflows smoothly
- Code is simple and debuggable

## Notes

- If any task fails testing, STOP and debug before continuing
- Add console.log statements liberally for debugging
- Test in actual Electron app, not just in theory
- Keep functions small and simple
- No task should take more than 30 minutes to implement and test
