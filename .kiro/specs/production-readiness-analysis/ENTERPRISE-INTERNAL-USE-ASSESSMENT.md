### Key Insight

**For internal enterprise use, you're at 77% readiness, not 54%!**

Many "critical" gaps for a product are **optional** for internal deployment:
- ✅ No need for auto-update (you control deployment)
- ✅ No need for multi-tenant security (single enterprise)
- ✅ No need for public code signing (internal apps)
- ✅ No need for SaaS-level monitoring (existing tools)
- ✅ No need for customer support features
