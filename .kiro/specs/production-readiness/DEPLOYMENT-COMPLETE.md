  messages-<timestamp>.log
```

## Configuration

Default configuration (in `platform-launcher.js`):
```javascript
{
  enabled: true,
  storageDir: '<userdata>/.iab-storage',
  maxFileSize: 10 * 1024 * 1024,  // 10MB
  maxFiles: 100,
  flushInterval: 5000  // 5 seconds
}
```

## Verification

Run this to verify everything is integrated:
```bash
node test-launcher-integration.js
```

Expected output:
```
✅ MessageBroker import
✅ MessagePersistence import
✅ initializeProductionServices
✅ messageBroker initialization
✅ messagePersistence initialization
✅ Message persistence on broadcast
✅ Shutdown handler
✅ MessageBroker.js (8682 bytes)
✅ MessagePersistence.js (8112 bytes)
✅ All checks passed!
```
