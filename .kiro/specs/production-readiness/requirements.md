# Production Readiness Requirements

## Introduction

This spec addresses the critical gaps identified in the production readiness analysis to transform the MVP desktop interoperability platform into an enterprise-grade system comparable to OpenFin. The work is divided into phases focusing on Core IAB Architecture, Security & Isolation, Performance & Scalability, and Reliability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Message Broker Architecture

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want a scalable message routing system so that the platform can handle 500+ concurrent applications without performance degradation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a message is published to a topic THEN the system SHALL route it using O(1) lookup for exact matches
2. WHEN wildcard subscriptions are used (e.g., `market.*.prices`) THEN the system SHALL correctly match and route messages
3. WHEN a client is offline THEN the system SHALL queue messages for delivery upon reconnection
4. WHEN a message cannot be delivered after retries THEN the system SHALL move it to a dead letter queue
5. WHEN message history is requested THEN the system SHALL provide the last N messages for a topic
6. WHEN the system has 100+ applications THEN message routing latency SHALL be <5ms at p99

### Requirement 2: Message Persistence

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want all messages persisted to disk so that no data is lost during network failures or system restarts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a message is published THEN the system SHALL persist it to disk within 1 second
2. WHEN the system restarts THEN the system SHALL be able to replay messages from a given timestamp
3. WHEN storage reaches configured limits THEN the system SHALL rotate files and clean up old data
4. WHEN persistence is disabled THEN the system SHALL continue to function without disk writes
5. WHEN querying historical messages THEN the system SHALL retrieve them from persistent storage

### Requirement 3: Security Hardening

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want proper permission controls so that applications cannot access resources without user consent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an application requests a permission THEN the system SHALL show a user consent dialog
2. WHEN a user denies permission THEN the application SHALL NOT be able to access the protected resource
3. WHEN sensitive data needs encryption THEN the system SHALL use AES-256-GCM with proper key management
4. WHEN an application attempts unauthorized access THEN the system SHALL log the security event
5. WHEN reviewing security events THEN administrators SHALL have access to a complete audit trail

### Requirement 4: Process Isolation

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want each application in a separate process so that one application crash doesn't affect others.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an application is launched THEN it SHALL run in its own OS process
2. WHEN an application crashes THEN other applications SHALL continue running unaffected
3. WHEN monitoring resource usage THEN the system SHALL report per-application CPU and memory
4. WHEN an application exceeds resource limits THEN the system SHALL terminate only that application
5. WHEN an application is terminated THEN its process SHALL be fully cleaned up

### Requirement 5: Web Platform Security

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want strict iframe sandboxing so that web applications cannot escape their security boundaries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an iframe is created THEN it SHALL NOT have both `allow-same-origin` and `allow-scripts` permissions
2. WHEN postMessage is used THEN the system SHALL validate message origins against a whitelist
3. WHEN Content Security Policy is enforced THEN inline scripts SHALL be blocked
4. WHEN an application attempts cross-origin access THEN the system SHALL deny it
5. WHEN security violations occur THEN they SHALL be logged for audit

### Requirement 6: Reliability & Error Handling

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want automatic recovery from failures so that the system remains available without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a message delivery fails THEN the system SHALL retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff
2. WHEN an application crashes THEN the system SHALL automatically restart it
3. WHEN a client disconnects THEN the system SHALL maintain subscriptions for 30 seconds for reconnection
4. WHEN monitoring system health THEN heartbeat checks SHALL detect unresponsive applications within 30 seconds
5. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be categorized and reported with actionable information

### Requirement 7: Monitoring & Diagnostics

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want comprehensive monitoring so that I can diagnose issues and track system health.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN querying system statistics THEN the system SHALL report client count, message throughput, and queue sizes
2. WHEN a message is published THEN it SHALL include a correlation ID for distributed tracing
3. WHEN reviewing message flow THEN operators SHALL be able to trace a message through the entire system
4. WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL emit metrics for alerting
5. WHEN investigating issues THEN operators SHALL have access to message history and dead letter queue

### Requirement 8: Audit Logging

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want complete audit logs so that all security-relevant actions are tracked for regulatory compliance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a permission is requested THEN the event SHALL be logged with timestamp, application, and user decision
2. WHEN a security violation occurs THEN it SHALL be logged with full context
3. WHEN an application is launched or terminated THEN it SHALL be logged
4. WHEN audit logs are queried THEN they SHALL be tamper-proof and complete
5. WHEN generating compliance reports THEN all required data SHALL be available
