# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for advanced window management features that will enhance the desktop interoperability platform with sophisticated window grouping/tabbing, docking, and advanced snapping capabilities. These features will enable users to organize multiple application windows efficiently, similar to modern browser tab management and professional window management tools.

The goal is to provide enterprise users with powerful window organization tools that improve productivity by allowing seamless window arrangement, grouping related applications together, and providing intelligent snapping behaviors across single and multi-monitor setups.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Window Grouping and Tabbing

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple windows are selected THEN the system SHALL allow grouping them into a tabbed container
2. WHEN windows are grouped THEN the system SHALL display a tab bar showing all grouped windows
3. WHEN a tab is clicked THEN the system SHALL bring that window to the front within the group
4. WHEN a tab is dragged out THEN the system SHALL ungroup that window and make it independent
5. WHEN a window is dragged onto a group THEN the system SHALL add it to the group as a new tab
6. WHEN a group is moved THEN the system SHALL move all windows in the group together
7. WHEN a group is resized THEN the system SHALL resize all windows in the group to match
8. WHEN a group is closed THEN the system SHALL provide options to close all windows or ungroup them
9. WHEN tabs are reordered THEN the system SHALL update the tab order in the group
10. IF a window in a group crashes THEN the system SHALL maintain the group and mark the crashed window

### Requirement 2: Window Docking

**User Story:** As an end user, I want to dock windows to screen edges and other windows, so that I can create organized layouts quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a window is dragged near a screen edge THEN the system SHALL show a visual preview of the docked position
2. WHEN a window is released near a screen edge THEN the system SHALL dock the window to that edge
3. WHEN a window is docked to the left edge THEN the system SHALL resize it to occupy the left half of the screen
4. WHEN a window is docked to the right edge THEN the system SHALL resize it to occupy the right half of the screen
5. WHEN a window is docked to the top edge THEN the system SHALL maximize the window
6. WHEN a window is docked to a corner THEN the system SHALL resize it to occupy that quarter of the screen
7. WHEN multiple windows are docked THEN the system SHALL maintain docking relationships when windows are moved
8. WHEN a docked window is undocked THEN the system SHALL restore its previous size and position
9. WHEN windows are docked to each other THEN the system SHALL create edge-to-edge alignment
10. IF the screen resolution changes THEN the system SHALL adjust docked window positions proportionally

### Requirement 3: Advanced Snapping

**User Story:** As an end user, I want intelligent window snapping with multiple layout options, so that I can arrange windows precisely and efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a window is dragged THEN the system SHALL detect nearby snap targets (edges, other windows, grid positions)
2. WHEN a window approaches a snap target THEN the system SHALL show a visual indicator of the snap position
3. WHEN a window is released near a snap target THEN the system SHALL snap the window to that position
4. WHEN snapping to another window THEN the system SHALL align edges (top, bottom, left, right)
5. WHEN snapping to a grid THEN the system SHALL align the window to configurable grid positions
6. WHEN holding a modifier key THEN the system SHALL disable snapping temporarily
7. WHEN multiple snap targets are available THEN the system SHALL prioritize the closest target
8. WHEN windows are snapped together THEN the system SHALL maintain snap relationships during resize
9. WHEN a snapped window is resized THEN the system SHALL adjust adjacent snapped windows proportionally
10. IF snap sensitivity is configured THEN the system SHALL use the configured snap distance threshold

### Requirement 4: Multi-Monitor Support

**User Story:** As an end user, I want window management features to work seamlessly across multiple monitors, so that I can organize windows across my entire workspace.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dragging windows between monitors THEN the system SHALL maintain grouping relationships
2. WHEN docking on a secondary monitor THEN the system SHALL use that monitor's dimensions
3. WHEN snapping across monitors THEN the system SHALL detect edges at monitor boundaries
4. WHEN a monitor is disconnected THEN the system SHALL move windows to available monitors
5. WHEN a monitor is reconnected THEN the system SHALL restore windows to their previous positions
6. WHEN maximizing on a specific monitor THEN the system SHALL maximize within that monitor's bounds
7. WHEN creating window groups across monitors THEN the system SHALL allow cross-monitor groups

### Requirement 5: Keyboard Shortcuts and Accessibility

**User Story:** As an end user, I want keyboard shortcuts for window management, so that I can organize windows without using the mouse.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a keyboard shortcut is pressed THEN the system SHALL perform the corresponding window action
2. WHEN snapping via keyboard THEN the system SHALL snap the active window to the specified position
3. WHEN grouping via keyboard THEN the system SHALL add the active window to the selected group
4. WHEN cycling through tabs via keyboard THEN the system SHALL switch between grouped windows
5. WHEN moving windows via keyboard THEN the system SHALL move the active window in the specified direction
6. IF keyboard shortcuts conflict THEN the system SHALL allow customization of shortcuts
7. WHEN using screen readers THEN the system SHALL announce window management actions

### Requirement 6: Visual Feedback and Animations

**User Story:** As an end user, I want clear visual feedback during window management operations, so that I understand what will happen before I complete an action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dragging a window THEN the system SHALL show a semi-transparent preview of the window
2. WHEN hovering over a snap zone THEN the system SHALL highlight the target area
3. WHEN docking is available THEN the system SHALL show overlay indicators on screen edges
4. WHEN grouping windows THEN the system SHALL animate the grouping transition
5. WHEN ungrouping windows THEN the system SHALL animate the separation
6. WHEN snapping windows THEN the system SHALL animate the snap transition smoothly
7. IF animations are disabled THEN the system SHALL perform instant transitions

### Requirement 7: Persistence and State Management

**User Story:** As an end user, I want my window arrangements to be saved, so that I can restore my workspace layout after restarting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN windows are grouped THEN the system SHALL save the group configuration
2. WHEN windows are docked THEN the system SHALL save the docking relationships
3. WHEN the platform restarts THEN the system SHALL restore window groups and positions
4. WHEN a workspace is saved THEN the system SHALL include grouping and docking information
5. WHEN a workspace is loaded THEN the system SHALL recreate groups and docking arrangements
6. IF a window cannot be restored THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue with other windows

### Requirement 8: API and Programmatic Control

**User Story:** As a developer, I want APIs to control window grouping, docking, and snapping programmatically, so that I can create custom window management workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calling groupWindows() THEN the system SHALL create a window group with specified windows
2. WHEN calling ungroupWindow() THEN the system SHALL remove a window from its group
3. WHEN calling dockWindow() THEN the system SHALL dock a window to the specified edge
4. WHEN calling snapWindow() THEN the system SHALL snap a window to the specified position
5. WHEN calling getWindowGroup() THEN the system SHALL return the group information for a window
6. WHEN window management events occur THEN the system SHALL emit events for listeners
7. WHEN querying snap targets THEN the system SHALL return available snap positions

### Requirement 9: Configuration and Customization

6. IF features are disabled THEN the system SHALL hide corresponding UI elements

### Requirement 10: Performance and Resource Management
