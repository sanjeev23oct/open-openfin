# End-User Readiness Assessment

## Current Status: ❌ NOT READY FOR END USERS

### What's Implemented (Backend Only)
- ✅ WindowGroupManager - API only
- ✅ DockingManager - API only  
- ✅ SnappingManager - API only
- ✅ OverlayManager - API only
- ✅ Tab Bar UI - exists but not triggered
- ✅ Overlay UI - exists but not triggered

### What's MISSING (Critical for End Users)

#### 1. ❌ Automatic Drag Detection
**Problem:** User drags a window, nothing happens
**Need:** Detect when user starts dragging any window
**Status:** NOT IMPLEMENTED

#### 2. ❌ Automatic Docking Trigger
**Problem:** Overlays don't appear when dragging
**Need:** Show dock zones automatically on drag
**Status:** NOT IMPLEMENTED

#### 3. ❌ Automatic Snapping Trigger  
**Problem:** Windows don't snap when moved near edges
**Need:** Detect proximity and snap automatically
**Status:** NOT IMPLEMENTED

#### 4. ❌ Window Title Bar Integration
**Problem:** No way to initiate grouping from UI
**Need:** Right-click menu or drag-to-group gesture
**Status:** NOT IMPLEMENTED

#### 5. ❌ Automatic Tab Bar Creation
**Problem:** Tab bar doesn't appear when windows are grouped
**Need:** Tab bar appears automatically
**Status:** PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED (API exists, not triggered)

### Missing UI Integration Tasks

These tasks MUST be added to tasks.md:

**Task 17: Drag Detection Integration**
- Detect window drag start from Electron
- Hook into BrowserWindow move events
- Trigger docking/snapping managers on drag

**Task 18: Automatic Overlay Display**
- Show dock zones when drag starts
- Show snap preview when near targets
- Hide overlays when drag ends

**Task 19: Window Title Bar Context Menu**
- Add right-click menu to window title bars
- "Group with..." option
- "Dock to..." option
- "Ungroup" option (if in group)

**Task 20: Gesture-Based Grouping**
- Drag window onto another to group
- Shake gesture to ungroup
- Double-click title bar to maximize/restore

**Task 21: Visual Indicators**
- Show group indicator on grouped windows
- Show dock indicator on docked windows
- Show snap indicator on snapped windows

**Task 22: Keyboard Shortcuts (User-Facing)**
- Win+Arrow for docking
- Ctrl+Tab for tab switching
- Win+Shift+Arrow for snapping

### Why Current Implementation is NOT User-Ready

1. **No Automatic Triggers** - Everything requires API calls
2. **No Visual Feedback** - User doesn't know features exist
3. **No Discoverability** - No UI hints or menus
4. **No Gestures** - Can't use mouse to trigger features
5. **No Integration** - Not connected to window lifecycle

### What End User Expects

**Docking:**
1. Drag window near edge → Overlay appears
2. Keep dragging → Zone highlights
3. Release → Window docks

**Snapping:**
1. Drag window near another → Preview shows
2. Release → Windows snap together

**Grouping:**
1. Right-click title bar → "Group with..." menu
2. OR drag window onto another → Group created
3. Tab bar appears automatically

**Current Reality:**
1. Drag window → Nothing happens
2. No menus, no overlays, no feedback
3. Must write code to test features

### Conclusion

The backend is solid, but there's ZERO end-user functionality. All features require programmatic API calls. This is like building a car engine without a steering wheel, pedals, or dashboard.

**Recommendation:** Add Tasks 17-22 to tasks.md and implement them before claiming "ready for users"
