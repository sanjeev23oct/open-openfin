# Task 17 Implementation Summary

## Automatic Drag Detection and Coordination

### Overview
Implemented automatic drag detection that hooks into Electron window move events and coordinates drag operations across all window management managers (docking, snapping, overlays).

### Components Implemented

#### 1. DragDetectionService (`packages/runtime/src/services/DragDetectionService.ts`)
A new service that automatically detects when users drag windows and emits events for coordination.

**Key Features:**
- Hooks into Electron's `will-move` and `moved` events
- Distinguishes between user-initiated and programmatic window moves
- Implements drag threshold (5px) to avoid false positives
- Runs at 60 FPS for smooth tracking
- Emits `drag-start`, `drag-update`, and `drag-end` events

**Key Methods:**
- `registerWindow(windowId, browserWindow)` - Register a window for drag detection
- `markProgrammaticMove(windowId)` - Mark a move as programmatic to avoid triggering drag
- `isDragging(windowId)` - Check if a window is currently being dragged

#### 2. WindowManager Integration
Updated WindowManager to integrate drag detection with all managers.

**Changes Made:**
- Added `DragDetectionService` as a manager
- Implemented `setupDragDetection()` method that:
  - Listens for drag-start events and starts operations on DockingManager and SnappingManager
  - Shows dock zone overlays automatically
  - Listens for drag-update events and updates all managers
  - Updates overlay highlights based on active zones/targets
  - Listens for drag-end events and completes drag operations
  - Hides overlays when drag ends

- Updated `createWindow()` to register windows with drag detection
- Updated programmatic move methods to mark moves as programmatic:
  - `dockWindow()`
  - `snapWindow()`

### How It Works

1. **Drag Start Detection:**
   - User starts dragging a window
   - `will-move` event fires
   - DragDetectionService tracks initial position
   - After 5px movement, emits `drag-start` event
   - WindowManager receives event and:
     - Calls `startDragOperation()` on DockingManager
     - Calls `startDragOperation()` on SnappingManager
     - Shows dock zone overlays

2. **Drag Update:**
   - As user drags, `moved` events fire
   - DragDetectionService emits `drag-update` events at 60 FPS
   - WindowManager receives updates and:
     - Updates DockingManager with cursor position
     - Updates SnappingManager with cursor position and window size
     - Highlights active dock zone if near edge
     - Shows snap preview if near snap target

3. **Drag End:**
   - User releases window (detected via timeout after last move)
   - DragDetectionService emits `drag-end` event
   - WindowManager receives event and:
     - Calls `completeDragOperation()` which:
       - Completes docking if near dock zone
       - Completes snapping if near snap target
       - Cancels both if no target
     - Hides all overlays

### Benefits

1. **Automatic Operation:** Users don't need to explicitly trigger docking/snapping - it happens automatically as they drag
2. **Visual Feedback:** Overlays appear automatically showing where windows will dock/snap
3. **Smooth Experience:** 60 FPS updates provide smooth, responsive feedback
4. **Smart Detection:** Distinguishes between user drags and programmatic moves
5. **Coordinated:** All managers work together seamlessly

### Testing

The implementation:
- ✅ Builds successfully
- ✅ Integrates with existing WindowManager
- ✅ Coordinates with DockingManager, SnappingManager, and OverlayManager
- ✅ Handles programmatic moves correctly

### Next Steps

Task 17 is complete. The automatic drag detection system is now in place and will trigger docking/snapping operations automatically as users drag windows. The next tasks (18-24) will build on this foundation to add:
- Context menus for manual window management
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Visual indicators
- End-to-end testing
