# Railway Deployment - Successfully Fixed

## Problem Summary
The Railway deployment was failing because:
1. The monorepo structure with workspace dependencies was too complex for Railway to build
2. The `.railwayignore` file in `packages/web-platform` was excluding the `dist` folder
3. Building the entire monorepo on Railway was timing out due to heavy dependencies (Electron, etc.)

## Solution
Created a standalone deployment package with pre-built files:

### Structure
```
deploy-package/
├── dist/              # Pre-built Vite output (copied from packages/web-platform/dist)
├── server.js          # Simple Express server for SPA routing
├── package.json       # Minimal dependencies (only express)
├── nixpacks.toml      # Railway build configuration
└── railway.json       # Railway deployment settings
```

### Key Files

**server.js** - Express server that:
- Serves static files from `dist/`
- Handles SPA routing (all routes → index.html)
- Listens on Railway's PORT environment variable

**package.json** - Only production dependency:
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.18.2"
  }
}
```

**nixpacks.toml** - Build configuration:
```toml
[phases.setup]
nixPkgs = ["nodejs-18_x"]

[phases.install]
cmds = ["cd deploy-package && npm install --production"]

[phases.build]
cmds = ["echo 'Using pre-built dist folder'"]

[start]
cmd = "cd deploy-package && node server.js"
```

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Build Locally
```bash
cd packages/web-platform
npm run build
```

### 2. Copy to Deploy Package
```bash
cp -r packages/web-platform/dist deploy-package/
```

### 3. Deploy to Railway
```bash
# From project root
git add deploy-package/
git commit -m "Update deployment package"
git push origin main
```

Railway will automatically detect the changes and deploy.

### Alternative: Manual Deploy
```bash
cd deploy-package
railway up
```

## Configuration Updates

### Root Level Changes
- **nixpacks.toml**: Updated to point to `deploy-package/`
- **railway.json**: Updated start command to `cd deploy-package && node server.js`
- **.railwayignore**: Created to exclude unnecessary files
- **.dockerignore**: Created to optimize Docker builds

### Package Level Changes
- **packages/web-platform/.railwayignore**: Removed `dist` from ignore list
- **packages/web-platform/package.json**: Added `express` dependency
- **packages/web-platform/server.js**: Created Express server (also copied to deploy-package)

## Deployment URL
https://open-openfin-production.up.railway.app

## Health Check
- Path: `/`
- Timeout: 100s
- Status: ✅ Passing

## Benefits of This Approach
1. **Fast Builds**: No compilation needed on Railway (uses pre-built files)
2. **Minimal Dependencies**: Only Express.js needed in production
3. **Reliable**: No workspace resolution or build timeout issues
4. **Simple**: Easy to understand and maintain
5. **Portable**: Can be deployed to any Node.js hosting platform

## Auto-Launch Feature
The web platform now automatically launches Ticker List and Ticker Details in a split-screen layout when loaded:
- **Ticker List** - Left side (50% width)
- **Ticker Details** - Right side (50% width)
- Both apps are positioned and sized automatically
- FDC3 communication works between them out of the box

This provides an immediate demo of the platform's capabilities without requiring manual app launching.

## Future Updates
When you update the web platform:
1. Build locally: `cd packages/web-platform && npm run build`
2. Copy dist: `cp -r packages/web-platform/dist/. deploy-package/dist/`
3. Commit and push: `git add -f deploy-package/dist && git commit -m "Update web platform" && git push`

Note: Use `-f` flag to force add the dist folder since it's normally gitignored.

## Notes
- The `dist` folder is committed to git (normally ignored) specifically for Railway deployment
- Keep the deploy-package in sync with packages/web-platform/dist after builds
- The Express server is production-ready and handles SPA routing correctly
