# Commit Summary: Web Platform with FDC3 Demo Apps

## Overview
This commit adds a fully functional browser-based FDC3 interop platform with rich demo applications and complete window management.

## What's New

### 1. FDC3 Core Package (Shared)
- **New Package**: `@desktop-interop/fdc3-core`
- Platform-agnostic FDC3 logic (ChannelManager, IntentResolver, ContextRouter)
- Can be used by both desktop (Electron) and web (browser) platforms
- Built as ESM modules for browser compatibility

### 2. Web Platform Enhancements
- **Window Resizing**: Added resize handles on all edges and corners
- **FDC3 Communication**: PostMessage-based bridge for iframe apps
- **Message Routing**: Simplified broadcast handling for app-to-app communication

### 3. Rich Demo Applications
- **Ticker List**: 
  - 12 stock tickers with real-time price updates
  - Search functionality
  - Professional UI with Tailwind CSS
  - Broadcasts FDC3 instrument context on click
  
- **Ticker Details**:
  - Listens for FDC3 instrument context
  - Displays comprehensive stock information
  - Animated price charts using Chart.js
  - Key statistics and company info
  
- **News Feed**: Placeholder for future implementation

### 4. Documentation
- `DEMO-GUIDE.md`: Complete testing and demo instructions
- `WEB-PLATFORM-SETUP.md`: Setup instructions
- `PRODUCTION-READY.md`: Feature documentation

## Technical Changes

### Files Modified
- `packages/fdc3-core/` - New shared package
- `packages/fdc3/tsconfig.json` - Enable composite builds
- `packages/web-platform/src/core/BrowserWindowManager.ts` - Add resize functionality
- `packages/web-platform/src/core/PostMessageRouter.ts` - Handle simple FDC3 broadcasts
- `packages/web-platform/src/core/WebPlatformCore.ts` - Fix URL construction

### Build Configuration

## Desktop Platform Compatibility

âœ… **Desktop platform is NOT affected** by these changes:
- Desktop apps use `window.fdc3` API directly (no changes)
- Desktop runtime uses Electron's native windows (no changes)
- Only shared fdc3-core package is new (optional for desktop)
- All desktop functionality remains intact

## Testing

### Web Platform
```bash
cd packages/web-platform
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:3000
# Launch Ticker List and Ticker Details
# Click a ticker to see FDC3 communication
```

### Desktop Platform
```bash
npm run build
npm start
# Should work exactly as before
```
