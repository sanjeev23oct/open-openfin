# Quick Test Guide - UI Fixes

## What Was Fixed
1. ✅ Removed channel circles from header
2. ✅ Renamed to "Web Interop Platform"
3. ✅ Improved iframe loading for external apps

## How to Test

### 1. Start the Platform
```bash
cd packages/web-platform
npm run dev
```

### 2. Verify Header Changes
- ✅ Title should say "Web Interop Platform" (not "OpenFin Web Platform")
- ✅ No colored channel circles should be visible
- ✅ Header should show: `🚀 Web Interop Platform | [📱 Launch Apps] [📊 FDC3 Monitor] [💼 Workspaces]`

### 3. Test External App Loading

#### Test with Google (Should Work)
1. Click "📱 Launch Apps"
2. Click "➕ Add External App"
3. Enter:
   - Name: `Google`
   - URL: `https://www.google.com`
   - Icon: `🔍`
4. Click "Add App"
5. Click on the Google app card
6. ✅ Google should load successfully

#### Test with ChatGPT (Will Show Error - Expected)
1. Click "📱 Launch Apps"
2. Click "➕ Add External App"
3. Enter:
   - Name: `ChatGPT`
   - URL: `https://chat.openai.com`
   - Icon: `🤖`
4. Click "Add App"
5. Click on the ChatGPT app card
6. ✅ Should show error message: "Cannot Load Application - This website blocks iframe embedding"
7. ✅ Should show "Open in New Tab" button

#### Sites That Should Work
- ✅ Google: `https://www.google.com`
- ✅ Wikipedia: `https://www.wikipedia.org`
- ✅ GitHub: `https://github.com`
- ✅ Most news sites
- ✅ Your own web apps

#### Sites That Will Block (Expected)
- ❌ ChatGPT: `https://chat.openai.com`
- ❌ Most banking sites
- ❌ Many social media sites (Facebook, Twitter, etc.)
- ❌ Sites with strict security policies

## Why Some Sites Block Embedding

Sites like ChatGPT use security headers (`X-Frame-Options: DENY` or `Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'none'`) to prevent their content from being embedded in iframes. This is a security feature to prevent clickjacking attacks.

**This is normal and expected behavior.** The platform now handles this gracefully by:
1. Detecting the error
2. Showing a user-friendly message
3. Providing a link to open the site in a new tab

## Troubleshooting

### If you still see channel circles:
1. Hard refresh your browser: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Make sure you're running `npm run dev` from `packages/web-platform`

### If the title still says "OpenFin Web Platform":
1. Check that you're looking at the correct file: `packages/web-platform/index.html`
2. Hard refresh your browser
3. Restart the dev server

### If external apps still don't load:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Try a different site (some sites block all iframe embedding)
3. Make sure the URL starts with `https://`
